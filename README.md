Clustering Cryptocurrencies using K-Means and PCA
Description:
This analysis clusters cryptocurrency market data using K-Means and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality. The data is visualized using hvPlot for interactive exploration.

Steps:
Data Preprocessing:

Loaded the cryptocurrency market data and handled missing values.
Normalized the data using StandardScaler to ensure all features contribute equally.
K-Means Clustering:

Performed clustering on scaled data and used the Elbow method to identify the optimal number of clusters.
Visualized the clusters using hvPlot scatter plots.
PCA for Dimensionality Reduction:

Applied PCA to reduce the data to three principal components.
Visualized the PCA clusters and explained variance.
Visualizations:

Plotted Elbow curves to determine optimal k values for clustering.
Created scatter plots to visualize clusters based on both the original and PCA-reduced data.
How to Run:
Ensure the required libraries are installed: hvplot, pandas, scikit-learn.
Load the dataset: crypto_market_data.csv.
Execute the code to generate the visualizations and clustering results.
This summary captures the key aspects without including all the specific code. If this aligns with what you're looking for, it can be refined further depending on your style.
